{id: docker-intro}

## Why use Docker?
{id: why-use-docker}

* One of the big problems: Developers, Testers, and Production all have different environments.
* Onboarding new developers is hard.

* Makes it easy to have the exact same setup for development, testing, productions.
* Makes it easy for people to set up their development environment.

## What is Docker?
{id: what-is-docker}

* A light-weight Virtual Server.

* De-facto standard for containerization.

## Companies using Docker in Israel
{id: docker-in-israel}

{aside}
I know that most of the readers of these slides are from around the world, but I run most of my courses in Israel,
so I have special interest in knowing which companies are using docker and what job titles do the people who use it have.
At one point I might create similar pages for some other countries as well.

## Docker container vs. image
{id: docker-container-image}
{i: image}
{i: container}

{aside}
In the world of Docker an **image** is similar to an iso image in the world of VirtualBox.
When we run an image Docker creates a copy of it and it is now called a **container**.
A running instance of the image.
{/aside}

container = runtime image


* It is like instance = runtime class
* Or Virtual Machine = the running instance of an ISO file.
