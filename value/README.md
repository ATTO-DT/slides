## Subtitles
{id: subtitles}

* Faster cheaper better pick any 3
* Fast cheap low-risk
* Predictable software development


## Business needs for change
{id: business-needs-for-change}

* Reduce time to market
* Increase feature throughput

* Decrease cost
* Increase quality




## ITIL
{id: itil}

* ITIL - Information Technology Infrastructure Library.
* ITSM - IT service management.

## Two
{id: two-}

Systems of record (needs to be stable)
Systems of engagement (needs to change fast)


Continuous Improvement
Continuous Learning

Refactoring to minimize complication

Goal - Value

* What is our goal?
* Why are we here?

Goal of companies:
* The overall goal of the companies is to create more value to customers.
* More value to customer

## Values
{id: values}

* More value to customer


Goals of employees

* Higher salary.
* Keep their job.
* Learn new things that will also be valuable at another company.
* Enjoy their time at work (no late hours, no tension).

Time is Money

* The sooner the better.

* Getting USD 1,000,000 ten years from now is great.
* Getting it one year from now is much better.
* Getting it next week is even better than that.
* NPV Net Present Value

So "sooner" has a higher value than later.

* Putting a name on it marking with a v does not work well.
* Better to discuss what can and what cannot make a difference.

Development velocity

## The tension
{id: the-tension}

Fast development and stable software are traditionally seen as orthogonal to each other.

However research shows that using the right approach one can achieve fast-paced development and stable software.
(See the DevOps handbook.)

Two competing goals of the IT organization:

* Respond to the rapidly changing competitive landscape. (Development)
* Provide stable, reliable, and secure service to the customer. (Operations)

A special case of the above mentioned problem is the tension between developers and operations.
Traditionally Developers are more interested in creating software, using the latest libraries etc.
Operations are required to provide stability for the production system. Stability requires little or no changes to the software stack. (e.g. OS, third-party library, code)


## Deploy per day VS value  (Value creation)

* More value sooner
* Faster feedback
* Can the clients acctually absorb the changes?
* Can we deliver the frequent changes?
* How can we ensure the quality remins high?


## Deploy per day VS stability
{id: deploy-per-day-vs-stability}

A drawing: x coordinates risk of release (number of issues per release, stability of release)
y coordinates: frequency of releases. (The paradox)

Getting faster
A drawing of an arrow or just line. On the left side it is "an organization that releases software once a year"
on the right end "Amazon, releasing once a second".
Move further to the right on this line.
